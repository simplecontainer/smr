# Security Policy

We take the security of this project seriously and are committed to protecting our users. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow the process below so we can resolve it responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

⚠️ **Do not open a public issue.**

Instead, please email your findings to **security@simplecontainer.io**.

When reporting, include as much detail as possible:
- A clear description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the problem (if applicable).
- Any suggested fixes or patches.

You should receive an acknowledgment within **72 hours** confirming we have received your report.

## What Happens Next

1. **Triage & Verification**  
   Our maintainers will review your report to confirm whether it is valid and determine its severity and scope. We may reach out for additional clarification during this stage.

2. **Private Discussion**  
   If the report is confirmed, we will create a private draft advisory on GitHub (or other appropriate platform) to coordinate with you and maintainers. Other affected projects may also be contacted under embargo.

3. **Resolution & Disclosure**
  - A patch or fix will be developed and tested.
  - A coordinated disclosure timeline will be agreed upon.
  - Public advisories will be published once the fix is released.

We expect reporters to respect any agreed-upon embargo period until disclosure.

## Recognition
