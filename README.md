Quick start
===========

**Note: The project is not stable.**

This is a quick start tutorial for getting a simple container up and running.

## Description
A simple container manager is designed to ease life for the developers and DevOps engineers running containers on Docker.

Introducing objects which can be defined as YAML definition and sent to the simplecontainer manager to produce Docker container via reconciliation:

- Containers
- Container
- Configuration
- Resource
- Gitops
- CertKey
- HttpAuth

These objects let you manage Docker containers with configure features:

- Single Docker daemon only (Currently)
- Integrated DNS server isolated from Docker daemon
- GitOps: deploy objects from the GitOps repositories
- Replication of containers
- Reconciliation and tracking the lifecycle of the Docker containers
- Operators to implement third-party functionalities
- CLI client to interact with the simplecontainer manager
- Fast learning curve - no over complication
- Reliable dependency ordering and readiness probes
- Templating of the container objects to leverage secrets and configuration


Installation of the agent
-------------------------
To start using simple container first run it to generate cert.pem for client authentication.

Note: This is example for the localhost. If domain is example.com running on the virtual machine with IP 1.2.3.4,
just replace the DOMAIN and EXTERNALIP values.

```bash
docker run \
       -e DOMAIN=localhost \
       -e EXTERNALIP=127.0.0.1 \
       -v $HOME/smr:/home/smr-agent/.ssh \
       -it smr:latest create
```

This will generate certs, keys and will print out cert.pem. Save it to some file.

```azure
{"level":"info","ts":1720689117.5965548,"caller":"mtls/Mtls.go:70","msg":"generating mtls ca, server certificate pem and client certificate pem"}
Certificate is generated for the use by the smr client!
Copy-paste it to safe location for further use - it will not be printed anymore in the logs
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIJQgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCCSwwggkoAgEAAoICAQDygLkfhjuISYKe
... 
TRUNCATED OUTPUT FOR READABILITY
```
Afterward running will start simplecontainer as docker container and it will be able
to manage containers on top of docker.

```bash
docker run \
       -v $HOME/smr:/home/smr-agent/.ssh \
       -v /tmp:/tmp \
       -p 0.0.0.0:1443:1443 \
       --dns 127.0.0.1 \
       --name smr-agent \
       -it smr:latest
```

Installation of the client
--------------------------

Client CLI is used for communication to the simplecontainer over network using mTLS. 
It is secured by mutual verification and encryption.

To install client just download it from releases:

https://github.com/simplecontainer/client/releases

Example:

```azure
VERSION=v0.0.1
PLATFORM=linux-amd64
curl -o client https://github.com/simplecontainer/client/releases/download/$VERSION/client-$PLATFORM
sudo mv client /usr/bin/smr
smr context connect https://localhost:1443 cert.pem --context localhost
{"level":"info","ts":1720694421.2032707,"caller":"context/Connect.go:40","msg":"authenticated against the smr-agent"}
smr ps
GROUP  NAME  DOCKER NAME  IMAGE  IP  PORTS  DEPS  DOCKER STATE  SMR STATE
```
Afterward access to control plane of the simple container is configured.

## Running containers
Define containers.yaml file:
```yaml
kind: containers
meta:
  name: application-bundle
  group: app
spec:
  mysql:
    meta:
      name: mysql
      group: mysql
    spec:
      options:
        enabled: false
      container:
        image: "mysql"
        tag: "8.0"
        replicas: 1
        envs:
          - "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD={{ configuration.password }}"
        networks:
          - "ghost"
        ports:
          - container: "3306"
        readiness:
          - name: "mysql.*"
            operator: DatabaseReady
            timeout: "20s"
            body:
              ip: "mysql.mysql-mysql-1.cluster.private"
              username: "{{ configuration.username }}"
              password: "{{ configuration.password }}"
              port: "3306"
        configuration:
          username: "root"
          password: "{{ configuration.mysql.*.password }}"
```
Define configuration-mysql.yaml file:
```yaml
kind: configuration
spec:
  meta:
    group: mysql
    identifier: "*"
  spec:
    data:
      password: "{{ secret.mysql.mysql.password }}"
```
Run the next commands:
```bash
smr secret create secret.mysql.mysql.password 123456789
smr apply configuration-mysql.yaml
smr apply containers.yaml
smr ps

```

## GitOps

It is possible to hold definition YAML files in the repository and let the simplecontainer apply it from the repository.

```yaml
kind: gitops
spec:
  meta:
    group: test
    identifier: testApp
  spec:
    repoURL: "https://github.com/simplecontainer/examples"
    revision: "main"
    directoryPath: "/gitops/bundle"
```

Applying this definition will create GitOps object on the simplecontainer.

```bash
smr gitops list                               
GROUP  NAME     REPOSITORY                                   REVISION  SYNCED        AUTO   STATE    
test   testApp  https://github.com/simplecontainer/examples  main      Never synced  false  Drifted  

smr gitops test testApp sync 
```

In this example auto sync is disabled and needs to be triggered manually. When triggered the reconciler will apply 
all the definitions in the `/gitops/bundle` directory from the `https://github.com/simplecontainer/examples` repository.
