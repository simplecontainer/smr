## Branches

The `main` branch represents active development for upcoming releases.  
All new features and fixes should target `main`. Changes to release branches should only happen through **cherry-picked commits**, and only when relevant to maintenance (e.g., bug or security fixes).

Each release branch has a sponsoring maintainer who serves as the point of contact and is responsible for guidance on contributions to that branch.

ðŸš« **Note:** Release branches are not meant for new feature development. Only bug fixes and security updates are eligible for backports.
